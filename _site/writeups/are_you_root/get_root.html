<p>The last time I participated in a CTF was openCTF at Defcon back in August. I decided it had been a little too long. I asked a coworker if there were any good CTFs going on and he pointed me towards PicoCTF hosted by Carnegie Mellon University. I hopped on the team and went to work. The first problem I went after was titled “Are you root?”.</p>

<p>For this problem you’re presented with an address and port, as well as a C source file for the service running on the server. My initial approach was to connect to the server and observe the interface that was presented.
